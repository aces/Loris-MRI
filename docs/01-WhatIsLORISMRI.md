# 1.0 - What is LORIS-MRI?
LORIS-MRI is the backbone of the imaging component that makes up LORIS. These documents assume you have some knowledge regarding LORIS and a functioning installation. For information regarding LORIS itself, please consult the [LORIS wiki][1].
  
LORIS-MRI is responsible for the processing, visualizing, and archiving of uploaded MRI scans. It expects an uploaded, compressed file containing several [DICOM][2] files, processes this into [MINC][3] and [NII][4] files, and then archives these files onto the server. Knowledge of these file formats can be helpful, but are not necessary for using or installing LORIS-MRI.

What does LORIS-MRI accomplish? What problems does it solve? Why would somebody want it in their life?

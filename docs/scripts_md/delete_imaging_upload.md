# NAME

delete\_imaging\_upload.pl -- Delete everything that was produced (or part of what was produced) by the imaging pipeline for a given set of imaging uploads
                        IDs, all associated to the same `tarchive`.

# SYNOPSIS

perl delete\_imaging\_upload.pl \[-profile file\] \[-ignore\] \[-backup\_path basename\] \[-protocol\] \[-form\] \[-uploadID list\_of\_uploadIDs\]
            \[-type list\_of\_scan\_types\] \[-defaced\] \[-basename fileBaseName\] \[-nosqlbk\] \[-nofilesbk\] \[-extra\_mysqlcnf file\]

Available options are:

\-profile               : name of the config file in `../dicom-archive/.loris_mri` (defaults to `prod`).

\-ignore                : ignore files whose paths exist in the database but do not exist on the file system.
                         Default is to abort if such a file is found, irrespective of whether a backup file will
                         be created by the script (see `-nofilesbk` and `-nosqlbk`). If this option is used, a 
                         warning is issued and program execution continues.

\-nofilesbk             : when creating the backup file for the deleted upload(s), do not backup the files produced by
                         the imaging pipeline (default is to backup these files).

\-backup\_path &lt;path>    : specify the path of the backup file, which by default contains a copy of everything that the
                         script will delete, both on the file system and in the database (but see `-nofilesbk` and
                         `-nosqlbk`). The extension `.tar.gz` will be added to this base name to build the name of the final
                         backup file. If a file with this resulting name already exists, an error message is shown and the script
                         will abort. Note that `path` can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current directory. A 
                         backup file is always created unless options `-nofilesbk` and `-nosqlbk` are both used. By default, the
                         backup file name is `imaging_upload_backup.tar.gz` and is written in the current directory. Option 
                         `-backup_path` cannot be used if `-nofilesbk` and `-nosqlbk` are also used.

\-basename fileBaseName : basename of the file to delete. The file is assumed to either exist in table `files` or table 
                         `parameter_file`. This option should be used when targeting a specific (unique) file for deletion.
                         Note that the file will be deleted from both the database and the filesystem. This option cannot be 
                         used with options `-defaced` and `-form`.

\-uploadID              : comma-separated list of upload IDs (found in table `mri_upload`) to delete. The program will 
                         abort if the list contains an upload ID that does not exist. Also, all upload IDs must
                         have the same `tarchive` ID (which can be `NULL`).

\-protocol              : delete the imaging protocol(s) in table `mri_processing_protocol` associated to either the
                         upload(s) specified via the `-uploadID` option or any file that was produced using this (these)
                         upload(s). Let F be the set of files directly or indirectly associated to the upload(s) to delete.
                         This option must be used if there is at least one record in `mri_processing_protocol` that is tied
                         only to files in F. Protocols that are tied to files not in F are never deleted. If the files in F
                         do not have a protocol associated to them, the switch is ignored if used.

\-form                  : delete the entries in `mri_parameter_form` associated to the upload(s) passed on
                         the command line, if any (default is NOT to delete them).

\-type                  : comma-separated list of scan type names to delete. All the names must exist in table `mri_scan_type` or
                         the script will issue an error. This option cannot be used in conjunction with `-defaced`.

\-defaced               : fetch the scan types listed in config setting `modalities_to_delete` and perform a deletion of these scan
                         types as if their names were used with option `-type`. Once all deletions are done, set the `SourceFileID`
                         and `TarchiveSource` of all the defaced files in table &lt;files> to `NULL` and to the tarchive ID of the 
                         upload(s) whose arguments were passed to `-uploadID`, respectively.

\-nosqlbk               : when creating the backup file, do not add to it an SQL file that contains the statements used to restore 
                         the database to the state it had before the script was invoked. Adding this file, which will be named
                         `imaging_upload_restore.sql`, to the backup file is the default behaviour.

\-dumpOptions           : options to add to the mysqldump command. By default, the following options are used
                         `--no-create-info --compact --skip-extended-insert --no-tablespaces`.
                         Example of additional option: `--column-statistics=0` to disable column statistics flag in
                         mysqldump 8.

\-extra\_mysqlcnf &lt;file> : MySql config file containing the password to log in the database (see
                         `https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html` for a description of this file's format).
                         This file should only contain the password stored in the `@db` array defined in your `prod` file.
                         You should use that option if you do not have a default `.mysql.cnf` config file containing the credentials
                         to log in the database. If this option is used, `delete_imaging_upload.pl` will pass the option
                         `--defaults-extra-file=file` to the `mysqldump` command when creating a backup of the SQL tables. Note that
                         only the password is fetched in this file, the host name and user name used to access the database are actually
                         retrieved from the `prod` file.

# DESCRIPTION

This program deletes an imaging upload or specific parts of it from the database and the file system. There are four
possible ways in which this script can be used:

1\. Delete everything that is associated to the upload ID(s). Basically, for uploads on which the MRI pipeline was
successfully run, this removes all records tied to the upload in the following tables:
   a) `notification_spool`
   b) `files`
   c) `tarchive_series` and `tarchive_files`
   d) `mri_protocol_violated_scans`, `MRICandidateErrors` and `mri_violations_log`
   e) `files_intermediary`. 
   f) `parameter_file`
   g) `tarchive`
   h) `mri_upload`
   i) `bids_export_files`
   j) `mri_processing_protocol` if option `-protocol` is used (see below)
   k) `mri_parameter_form` if option `-form` is used (see below)

All the deletions and modifications performed in the database are done as part of a single transaction, so they either
all succeed or a rollback is performed and the database is not modified in any way. The ID of the upload to delete
is specified via option `-uploadID`. More than one upload can be deleted if they all have the same `TarchiveID` 
in table `mri_upload`: option `-uploadID` can take as argument a comma-separated list of upload IDs for this case.
If an upload that is deleted is the only one that was associated to a given session, the script will set the `Scan_done`
value for that session to 'N'. If option `-form` is used, the `mri_parameter_form` and its associated `flag` record 
are also deleted, for each deleted upload. If option `-protocol` is used and if there is a record in table 
`mri_processing_protocol` that is tied only to the deleted upload(s), then that record is also deleted.

`delete_imaging_upload.pl` cannot be used to delete an upload that has an associated MINC file that has been QCed.
In other words, if there is a MINC file tied to the upload that is targeted for deletion and if that MINC file has 
an associated record in table `files_qcstatus` or `feedback_mri_comments`, the script will issue an error message
and exit.

Before deleting any records in the database, the script will verify that all the records in tables a) through j) that 
represent file names (e.g. a record in `files`, a protocol file in `mri_processing_protocol`, etc...) refer to files
that actually exist on the file system. If it finds a record that does not meet that criterion, the script issues an 
error message and exits, leaving the database untouched. To avoid this check, use option `-ignore`. Each time a file
record is deleted, the file it refers to on the file system is also deleted. A backup will be created by 
`delete_imaging_upload.pl` of all the files that were deleted during execution. Option `-nofilesbk` can be used to 
prevent this. If created, the backup file will be named `imaging_upload_backup.tar.gz`. This name can be changed with
option `-backup_path`. Note that the file paths inside this backup archive are absolute. To restore the files in the archive,
one must use `tar` with option `--absolute-names`.

The script will also create a file that contains a backup of all the information that was deleted or modified from the 
database tables. This backup is created using `mysqldump` and contains an `INSERT` statement for every record erased.
When running `mysqldump` the script uses the database credentials in file `~/.my.cnf` to connect to the database. Option
`-extra_mysqlcnf` has to be used to specify an alternate credentials file when the default credential file does not exist
(see `https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html` for a descrption of MySQL option files format).
The backup produced by `mysqldump` will be part of the backup archive mentioned above unless option `-nosqlbk` is used.
If sourced back into the database with `mysql`, it should allow the database to be exactly like it was before
`delete_imaging_upload.pl` was invoked, provided the database was not modified in the meantime. The SQL backup file will
be named `imaging_upload_restore.sql`.

2\. Delete specific scan types from an archive. The behaviour of the script is identical to the one described above, except 
   that:
    a) the deletions are limited to MINC files of a specific scan type: use option `-type` with a comma-separated list
       of scan type names to specify which ones.
    b) everything associated to the MINC files deleted in a) is also deleted: this includes the processed files in 
       `files_intermediary` and the records in `mri_violations_log`.
    c) if `-protocol` is used and there is an entry in table `mri_processing_protocol` that is tied only to the files
       deleted in a), then that record is also deleted.
    d) tables `tarchive_series`, `tarchive_files`, `tarchive`, `mri_upload`, `notification_spool`, `MRICandidateErrors`
       and `mri_parameter_form` are never modified.
   Note that option `-type` cannot be used in conjunction with either option `-form` or option `-defaced`.

3\. Replace MINC files with their defaced counterparts. This is the behaviour obtained when option `-defaced` is used. As far as 
   deletions go, the behaviour of the script in this case is identical to the one described in 2), except that the list of 
   scan types to delete is fetched from the config setting `modalities_to_deface`. Use of option `-defaced` is not permitted
   in conjunction with option `-type` or option `-form`. Once all deletions are made, the script will change the `SourceFileID` 
   of all defaced files to `NULL` and set the `TarchiveSource` of all defaced files to the `TarchiveID` of the upload(s). 
   This effectively "replaces" the original MINC files with their corresponding defaced versions. Note that the script will issue 
   an error message and abort, leaving the database and file system untouched, if:
       a) A MINC file should have a corresponding defaced file but does not.
       b) A MINC file that has been defaced has an associated file that is not a defaced file.

4\. Delete a specific file that exists in table `files` or table `parameter_file` (in which case it will be associated to parameter
   `check_pic_filename`, `check_nii_filename`, `check_bval_filename` or `check_bvec_filename`). Note that once a file is
   deleted, all the files that have been derived/built using this deleted file will also be deleted. Use option `-basename fileBaseName`, 
   where `fileBaseName` is the basename of the file to delete, along with option `-uploadID` to use the script this way.

### deleteUploadsInDatabase($dbh, $filesRef, $scanTypesToDeleteRef, $optionsRef)

This method deletes all information in the database associated to the given upload(s)/scan type combination. 
More specifically, it deletes records from tables `notification_spool`, `tarchive_files`, `tarchive_series`
`files_intermediary`, `parameter_file`, `files`, `mri_protocol_violated_scans`, `mri_violations_log`
`MRICandidateErrors`, `mri_upload`, `tarchive`, `mri_processing_protocol` and `mri_parameter_form` 
(the later is done only if requested). It will also set the `Scan_done` value of the scan's session to 'N' for
each upload that is the last upload tied to that session. All the delete/update operations are done inside a single 
transaction so either they all succeed or they all fail (and a rollback is performed).

INPUTS:
  - $dbh       : database handle.
  - $filesRef  : reference to the array that contains the file informations for all the files
                 that are associated to the upload(s) passed on the command line.
  - $scanTypesToDeleteRef: reference to the array that contains the list of scan type names to delete.
  - $optionsRef: reference on the hash array of the options that were passed on the command line.

RETURNS:
  - A reference to a hash with two keys:
    \* SQL\_BACKUP\_DONE    => 1 if this method produced a file containing the SQL statements that restore the database state to what it was before calling this
    method, 0 otherwise.
    \* NB\_RECORDS\_DELETED => the number of records effectively deleted by this method.

### gzipBackupFile($backupPath)

### updateSessionTable($dbh, $mriUploadsRef, $tmpSQLFile)

Sets to `N` the `Scan_done` column of all `sessions` in the database that do not have an associated upload
after the script has deleted those whose IDs are passed on the command line. The script also adds an SQL statement
in the SQL file whose path is passed as argument to restore the state that the `session` table had before the deletions.

INPUTS:
   - $dbh       : database handle.
   - $mriUploadsRef: reference on an array of hashes containing the uploads to delete. Accessed like this:

                 in the array. The properties stored for each hash are: `UploadID`, `TarchiveID`, `FullPath`
                 `Inserting`, `InsertionComplete` and `SessionID`.
   - $tmpSQLFile: path of the SQL file that contains the SQL statements used to restore the deleted records.

### updateFilesIntermediaryTable($dbh, $filesRef, $tmpSQLFile)

Sets the `TarchiveSource` and `SourceFileID` columns of all the defaced files to `$tarchiveID` and `NULL`
respectively. The script also adds an SQL statement in the SQL file whose path is passed as argument to 
restore the state that the defaced files in the `files` table had before the deletions.

INPUTS:
   - $dbh       : database handle.
   - $filesRef: reference to the array that contains the file informations for all the files
                that are associated to the upload(s) passed on the command line.

### deleteMriParameterForm($dbh, $mriUploadsRef, $tmpSQLFile, $optionsRef)

Delete the entries in `mri_parameter_form` (and associated `flag` entry) for the upload(s) passed on the
command line. The script also adds an SQL statement in the SQL file whose path is passed as argument to 
restore the state that the `mri_parameter_form` and `flag` tables had before the deletions.

INPUTS:
   - $dbh       : database handle.
   - $mriUploadsRef: reference on an array of hashes containing the uploads to delete. Accessed like this:
                 `$mriUploadsRef->[0]->{'TarchiveID'}`(this would return the `TarchiveID` of the first `mri_upload`
                 in the array. The properties stored for each hash are: `UploadID`, `TarchiveID`, `FullPath`
                 `Inserting`, `InsertionComplete` and `SessionID`.
   - $tmpSQLFile: path of the SQL file that contains the SQL statements used to restore the deleted records.

# 4.0 - Scripts

## 4.1 - Perl documentation

All the perl scripts in the LORIS-MRI repository are documented. Users are 
invited to consult the documentation 

- at the terminal by typing:
```angular2html
perldoc %/PATH/TO/THE/SCRIPT/SCRIPT_NAME%
```

- in markdown format, on the [LORIS-MRI repository](../scripts_md/).

Whether at the terminal or on-line, all scripts' documentations follow a used
convention briefly outlined below:

<pre>
package XXXXX

=pod

=head1 NAME

Name of the package or script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A few lines of code on how to use the package or script

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Overall description of the package or script

=head2 Methods

=cut

use warnings;
use strict;

=pod

=head3 functionName($variable)

Short description of the function.

INPUT: short description of inputs or arguments

RETURNS: short description of the returned objects

=cut
sub functionName{
  ...
}
### REPEAT FUNCTION PART FOR EACH METHOD

1; # end of script

=pod

=head1 TO DO

Nothing planned (or things that are left to do)

=head1 BUGS

None reported (or list of bugs)

=head1 LICENSING

Neuroscience

## 4.2 - Pipeline flow

A very brief illustration of the key and expected outcomes at different steps in 
the execution of the pipeline are shown below. 

![pipeline_flow](images/pipeline_schematic.png) 

This figure highlights the few 
key scripts in the pipeline execution, the order in which they call each other, 
and their interactions with the diverse libraries and utility classes. It 
therefore serves as a tool to help project developers understand the pipeline
quickly, and develop independently project customizations and debugging skills.

## 4.3 - Common insertion scripts re-run

The flow in the diagram above corresponds to a new upload. Occasionally, 
however, projects might need to modify (partially or in full) the outcome of an 
inserted scan. The next section highlights the "how-to" of the most commonly 
encountered cases. 

#### Bypassing protocol violation checks

For cases when a scan has triggered a protocol violation, the MINC volume can be
  **force-loaded** into LORIS by running:
```
uploadNeuroDB/minc_insertion.pl -acquisition_protocol t2w -bypass_extra_file_checks -create_minc_pics -profile prod -globLocation -force  -tarchivePath /data/project/dataTransfer/library/2009/DCM_2009-09-25_project_20110214_185904581.tar -mincPath /data/project/data/trashbin/TarLoad-3-34-pVzGC5/xxx0067_703739_v12_20090925_222403_18e1_mri.mnc
```

Note carefully the following arguments:

- `-acquisition_protocol`: must be a known scan type according to the
    `mri_scan_type` table
- `-tarchive_Path`: the DICOM tarball
- `-mincPath`: note this file may have been placed in the `trashbin` directory

See also: [MRI-PR#141](https://github.com/aces/Loris-MRI/pull/141) for more
  examples.

#### Rerunning the Imaging pipeline

- If one of the final steps such as the MINC conversion is failing, you may
    wish to just re-run the `tarchiveLoader` script.
    
> When the need arises to re-load imaging data in LORIS, it is generally not
   sufficient to just re-run the MINC/NIfTI loading step (`tarchiveLoader` or
    `batch_uploads_tarchive`). The pipeline steps must be re-run starting
    with `dicomTar.pl` (see section 5.4 of
   [Pipeline Triggering Options documentation](05-PipelineLaunchOptions.md)).

In general, to re-load an imaging dataset through the pipeline from the start 
   (from `dicomTar.pl`) -- Ensure entries from the previous attempt to load the 
   dataset have been removed from the following database tables:

- `parameter_file`
- `mri_acquisition_dates`
- `files` (best to delete from this table last)
- `mri_upload`
- `session` - not recommended - only if necessary, and only if no other data is
    associated to this session (*e.g.* on the Behavioural side of LORIS).
- `tarchive`

It is also recommended to remove from the `tarchive` directory the last generated
  `*.tar` package for this dataset, as well as files in the `assembly/`, `pic/`, 
  and `trashbin/` directories.

If any Quality Control flags or comments exist for these scans, you may also
  wish to delete specific records from `files_qcstatus` and the `mri_feedback_*`
  tables, before deleting from the `files` table.

For backing up, re-labelling and re-loading MRI datasets with QC information,
  see [Beta Tutorial](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Reloading-MRI-data-for-mislabelled-session)

#### Multiple scanner datasets per session

In cases where a subject was scanned in two scanner sessions as part of the same
  study Timepoint, anonymize both DICOM datasets using the same Visit Label in 
  the Patient Name (or Patient ID) field of the DICOM, and upload as two 
  separate DICOM datasets. The insertion pipeline will automatically 
  associate and display both sets of images acquired in both scanner sessions 
  under the same `session` table record.

# Appendix A - Troubleshooting guideline

This section covers some of the most commonly encountered errors when running
the insertion scripts. They are divided into 3 separate tables, with each table 
handling errors originating from the LORIS-MRI installation (Table 1), the LORIS 
modules setup (Table 2), or the LORIS-MRI scripts (Table 3).


_**Table 1: Common errors encountered during LORIS-MRI installation, and their proposed solutions.**_

| **Error** | **Cause** | **How to Fix**|
|:------|:------|:----------| 
|`install_driver(mysql) failed: Can't locate DBD/mysql.pm`|Missing dependency|`sudo apt-get install libdbd-mysql-perl`|
|`ERROR: You don't have a configuration file named 'prod' in: /data/%PROJECT%/bin/mri/dicom-archive/.loris_mri/`| Your `environment` file does not contain your actual LORIS-MRI project name. Instead, it contains the placeholder `%PROJECT%` as provided in the 'generic' file and/or your `environment` file is not sourced| Source the environment file located in `/data/$PROJECT/bin/mri/` after making sure that the `$PROJECT` variable is replaced with your LORIS-MRI project name|
|`ERROR: You don't have a configuration file named 'prod' in: /data/loris-MRI/bin/mri/dicom-archive/.loris_mri/` *note*: `loris-MRI` is an example project name used in this illustration| Wrong file and/or directory permissions| Make sure that the `/data/$PROJECT/bin/mri` directory, and all directories within are readable by the user running the scripts (`lorisadmin` or the front-end `apache` user)|
|`ERROR: You don't have a configuration file named 'prod' in: /data/loris-MRI/bin/mri/dicom-archive/.loris_mri/` *note*: `loris-MRI` is an example project name used in this illustration| Syntax error in the `prod` file in the customized routines (for example a missing closing bracket)| Check the routines that were customized for your project needs|
|`DB connection failed`| Database credentials in the `prod` file were entered incorrectly during the install, or they were modified subsequently| Make sure that your `prod` file contains the correct database connection/credentials information in the `DATABASE Settings, Section I`|


_**Table 2: Common errors encountered due to missing LORIS (front-end) module setup steps, and their proposed solutions.**_

| **Error** | **Cause** | **How to Fix**|
|:------|:------|:----------| 
|Images thumbnails do not show up in Imaging Browser. They appear as a broken image icon|Wrong permissions to the `/data/$PROJECT/data/pic/` folder|Ensure that the `apache` user can read/execute the `pic` images folder|
|Images thumbnails do not show up in Imaging Browser. They appear as a broken image icon|Wrong `Images` path under the `Paths` section in LORIS Configuration module|Ensure the path to the images is correct, typically `/data/$PROJECT/data/`|
|4-D images (*e.g.* DTI, fMRI) in brainbrowser do not show any volumes (Play button not displayed)|Most likely a dcm2mnc conversion error|Post an issue on the [minc-toolkit Github Issues page](https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit/issues)|
|Brainbrowser says `Loading…` but no image shows up|Wrong permissions to the `/data/$PROJECT/data/assembly/` folder|Ensure that the apache user can read/execute the MINC `assembly` images folder|
|Brainbrowser says `Loading…` but no image shows up|Wrong `Images` path under the `Paths` section in LORIS Configuration module|Ensure the path to the MINC images is correct, typically `/data/$PROJECT/data/`| 
|Brainbrowser says `Loading…` but no image shows up|The `config.xml` in LORIS does not have the MINC Toolkit Path set properly|Fill out the path `<MINCToolsPath>` to the MINC Toolkit Installation in the `config.xml` (on the LORIS side). The last trailing `/` in the path is mandatory|


_**Table 3: Common errors encountered during execution of the LORIS-MRi insertion scripts, and their proposed solutions.**_

| **Error** | **Cause** | **How to Fix**|
|:------|:------|:----------| 
|`The Candidate info validation has failed`|PatientName/PatientID header in the DICOMs not anonymized according to the LORIS convention `(PSCID_CandID_VisitLabel)`|Use [DICAT](https://github.com/aces/DICAT) to anonymize it properly OR Use the DICOM toolkit `dcmodify` command. The following one-line command (to be run from the folder where the DICOM files are) which anonymizes your entire folder of DICOM files is: `for i in $(find -type f); do dcmodify -ma PatientName="PSCID_CandID_VisitLabel" -nb $i; done`|
|`The Candidate info validation has failed`|The upload scan contains at least one file that is NOT of type DICOM (.bmp or .pdf are common)|Remove any file in the upload that is not of type DICOM|
|`... error message = 'No space left on device ...'`|The temporary directory where the insertion scripts perform its intermediate steps is full. This directory is set to a default value of `/tmp` as specified in the line `export TMPDIR=/tmp` of the `environment` file |Change the `TMPDIR` path in the environment file to a directory with enough space. A good rule of thumb is to have at least 2-3 times the size of the scan being processed as writable space. This space is usually automatically emptied by the pipeline upon a successful execution|
|`ERROR: This class is designed around the notion of a 'Study'. You can't use it with data from multiple studies.  The following study UIDs were found: '1.3.12.2.1107.66060.300000004' '1.3.12.2.1107.66060.300000007' The dicomTar execution has failed`|The upload contains acquisitions from two scanning sessions|Separate into two separate uploads|
|`Out of memory!` during the execution of `dicomTar.pl`|The Transfer syntax of the uploaded scan is other than Little Endian Explicit (such as Big endian, Little Endian Implicit or JPEG lossless)|First run `dcmdump` on one of the DICOM files within your archive. Look for the value of the tag `TransferSyntaxUID`. If it is of the form `JPEGLossless*` you will have to convert all the DICOM files in your archive so that the transfer syntax becomes Little Endian Explicit. You can use `dcmdjpeg` to do so, with a command like `dcmdjpeg file.dcm file.dcm` for each file. For those files with a transfer syntax other than `JPEGLossless*`, use the DICOM toolkit `dcmconv` to convert. An example command that changes the transfer syntax to Little Endian Explicit on all DICOM files within a given folder is: `for i in $(find -type f); do dcmconv --write-xfer-little $i $i; done`|
|`Number of MINC files that will be considered for inserting into the database: 0. No data could be converted into valid MINC files.` Your project's excluded series descriptions `will not be considered!`|The upload contains only acquisitions that have `SeriesDescription` which are excluded by the project|Projects can specify what acquisitions' `SeriesDescription` are not to be processed by default in LORIS|
|My uploaded DICOM study contains 6 modalities but only 5 were inserted. The 6th modality was not converted to MINC, neither inserted into the MRI Violated Scans module. In addition, during insertion, the message `Number of MINC files that will be considered for inserting into the database: 5` is displayed, confirming that only 5 files are considered|The missing modality is probably matching one of the excluded series descriptions set in the Config Module under the Imaging Pipeline section. `tarchiveLoader` is specifically 'instructed' to exclude those modalities|Make sure these excluded series  descriptions have correctly been set (note, they need to be entered as an exact match to what is present in the DICOM file)|
|My uploaded DICOM study contains 6 modalities but only 5 were inserted. The 6th modality was not converted to MINC, neither inserted into the MRI Violated Scans module. In addition, during insertion, the message `Number of MINC files that will be considered for inserting into the database: 5` is displayed, confirming that only 5 files are considered|Probably the DICOM headers have blank SeriesNumber. LORIS-MRI generates MINC files and names them temporarily (in intermediate insertion steps) based on their SeriesNumber, before it proceeds to renaming them once the protocol is identified from the `mri_protocol` table. Having no SeriesNumber defaults to `0`, causing overwrites on the intermediate MINC files generated|Ensure that your DICOM headers include a non-blank SeriesNumber for every acquisition in that specific study|
|`The target directory does not contain a single DICOM file`|Probably the DICOM headers have blank StudyUID. The logic of insertion within LORIS-MRI depends on a StudyUID header|Ensure that your DICOM headers include a non-blank StudyUID header|
|My resting-state fMRI scans are tagged as task fMRI although I have 2 entries in the `mri_protocol` table|The resting-state scan has parameters that match those of the task entry of the `mri_protocol` table, and the task-related entry in the `mri_protocol` table precedes that of the resting-state fMRI|Make sure the `mri_protocol` table has parameters that discern between all the study acquired modalities in an **exclusive** manner (*i.e.* no two row entries have overlapping parameters across all their columns)|
|`no MINCs inserted`|Possibly all the MINC images are violated scans|Check the details of the image headers (from the MRI Violated Scans module or using `mincheader`) against the `mri_protocol` table entries, and adjust the table protocol parameters accordingly|


### A.1 Installation troubleshooting notes

Key configuration points to verify:

- Depending on your operating system, some dependencies might be missing.
    During initial troubleshooting of the imaging pipeline, note any related
    error messages (*e.g.* `install_driver(mysql) failed: Can't locate DBD/mysql
   .pm`) and install missing packages as needed (*e.g.*
   `sudo apt-get install libdbi-perl`, `sudo apt-get install libdbd-mysql-perl`,
    `sudo apt-get install libarchive-zip-perl`).

- If your MINC toolkit is older than 1.9.14 and your scans have no Date of Birth
   value, you may see an age unit error during DICOM to MINC conversion.
   Instructions for compiling a more recent version of the MINC toolkit are 
   available on [MNI-BIC GitHub](https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2).

### A.2 Images display troubleshooting notes

Once an MRI scan session has been successfully inserted, it will be listed in
  the Imaging Browser main data table (also linked from the DICOM Archive
  sub-page: "View Images").

Verify in the Imaging Browser's View Session page that a `jpg` showing 3 slice
  orientations displays properly; if not, verify your permissions and restart
  apache:
```
sudo chmod o+r /data/$PROJECT/bin
sudo chmod o+r /data/$PROJECT/data
sudo service apache2 restart
```

If download links do not work, ensure that the `/data/$PROJECT/data/assembly`
  directory and subdirectories are executable.

### A.3 Logs troubleshooting notes

Error and output messages from the imaging insertion scripts are logged in files
  created under the `/data/$PROJECT/data/logs/` directory. To view messages from
  the last script run, consult the most recent log file modified in this
  directory. These log files reference an `uploadID` used to identify each
  imaging dataset -- consult the `mri_upload` database table to look up which
  `uploadID` has been assigned to your scans.

***Caveat:*** When the imaging insertion pipeline is auto-launched by the
  Imaging Uploader module, the pipeline scripts' log files are output to
  `/tmp/` and deleted. To avoid deletion, edit the Server Processes Manager
  function [deleteProcessFiles()](https://github.com/aces/Loris/blob/master/modules/server_processes_manager/php/AbstractServerProcess.class.inc#L521)
  to return false instead of true.

### A.4 Insertion script troubleshooting notes

If upload was successful but issues were encountered with the imaging insertion
  pipeline scripts:

- CentOS: check for additional dependencies/configurations (*e.g.* DICOM
    Dictionary path) in the detailed
    [CentOS Imaging Installation transcript](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/CentOS-Imaging-installation-transcript)
- Manually re-run the entire pipeline sequence using the 
`imaging_upload_file.pl` script
- If one of the final steps such as the MINC conversion is failing, you may
    wish to just re-run the `tarchiveLoader` script.
- See also [re-running the Imaging pipeline](#rerunning-the-imaging-pipeline)
    section for troubleshooting information.

# DESCRIPTION

A tool for producing an informative summary for DICOMs in a given directory
(scanner information, acquisitions list, acquisitions parameters...). This tool
can also compare the DICOM data present in two directories or compare the DICOM
data present in a given directory with what is stored in the database.

## METHODS

### read\_db\_metadata($StudyUID)

Accesses the database and gets the path of the file containing the metadata for
the given StudyUID.

INPUT: the DICOM Study Instance UID (StudyUID)

RETURNS: the path of the file containing the metadata for the given StudyUID or
         undef if none is found.

### version\_conflict($StudyUID)

Compares DICOM summary version numbers for a given StudyUID.

INPUT: the DICOM Study Instance UID (StudyUID)

RETURNS: the version number of the DICOM summary found in the database if the
         version is different from the current version of the script, 0 otherwise

### silly\_head()

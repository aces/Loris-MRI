# DESCRIPTION

This class provides a set of methods to fetch records from the `mri_scan_type`
table. If an operation cannot be executed successfully, a `NeuroDB::objectBroker::ObjectBrokerException`
will be thrown.

## Methods

### new(db => $db) >> (constructor)

Create a new instance of this class. The only parameter to provide is the
`Database` object used to access the database.

INPUT: the database object used to query the `mri_scan_type` table.

RETURN: new instance of this class.

### get($isCount, $columnValuesRef))

Fetches the entries in the `mri_scan_type` table that have specific column
values. This method throws a `NeuroDB::objectBroker::ObjectBrokerException`
if the operation could not be completed successfully.

INPUTS:
    - boolean indicating if only a count of the records found is needed
      or the full record properties.
    - reference to a hash array that contains the column values that the MRI records
      should have in order to be part of the result set (key: column name, value: column
      value).

RETURNS: a reference to an array of hash references. Every hash contains the values
        for a given row returned by the method call: the key/value pairs contain
        the name of a column (see `@MRI_SCAN_TYPE_FIELDS`) and the value it 
        holds, respectively. As an example, suppose array `$r` contains the result of a
        given call to this function. One would fetch the `Scan_type` of the 2nd record 
        returned using `$r-`\[1\]->{'Scan\_type'}>.
        If the method is called with `$isCount` set to true, then it will return
        a reference to an array containing a single hash reference, its unique key being 
        `'COUNT(*)'` with the associated value set to the selected count.

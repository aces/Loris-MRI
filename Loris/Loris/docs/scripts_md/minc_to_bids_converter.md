# NAME

minc\_to\_bids\_converter.pl -- a script that creates a BIDS compliant imaging
dataset from the MINC files present in the `assembly/` directory.

# SYNOPSIS

perl tools/minc\_to\_bids\_converter.pl `[options]`

Available options are:
\-profile             : name of the config file in `../dicom-archive/.loris_mri`
\-tarchive\_id         : The ID of the DICOM archive to be converted into a BIDS
                       dataset (optional, if not set, convert all DICOM archives)
\-dataset\_name        : Name/Description of the dataset to be generated in BIDS
                       format; for example BIDS\_First\_Sample\_Data. The BIDS data
                       will be stored in a directory with that `dataset_name`
                       under the `BIDS_export` directory.
\-slice\_order\_philips : Philips scanners do not have the `SliceOrder` in their
                       DICOM headers so it needs to be provided an argument to
                       this script. `ascending` or `descending` are expected.
                       If slice order is `interleaved`, then it needs to be logged
                       in the JSON as `Not Supplied`
\-verbose             : if set, be verbose

# DESCRIPTION

This \*\*BETA\*\* version script will create a BIDS compliant NIfTI file structure of
the MINC files currently present in the `assembly` directory. If the argument
`tarchive_id` is specified, only the images from that tarchive will be processed.
Otherwise, all `tarchive_id`'s present in the `tarchive` table will be processed.

Before running the script, make sure that:
  - the "MINC to BIDS Converter Tool Options" section of the Configuration module has been updated.
    Note: the "BIDS Validation options to ignore" field is optional. It needs to be used in case
    there are some known checks performed by the bids-validator that are known to fail. Complete
    list of error code for the bids-validator can be found at the following link:
    https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator/blob/master/bids-validator/utils/issues/list.js
  - the tables `bids_category`, `bids_scan_type_subcategory`, `bids_scan_type` and
    `bids_mri_scan_type_rel` have been populated and customized as per the project's
    acquisition protocols

Keep the following restrictions/expectations in mind when populating the above database tables:
  - The `bids_category` table will house the different imaging "categories" which a
    default install would set to `anat`, `func`, `dwi`, and `fmap`. More entries
    can be added as more imaging categories are supported by the BIDS standards.
  - The `bids_scan_type` table will house the different "BIDS scan types" which a
    default install would set to `T1w`, `T2w`, `FLAIR`, `bold`, `dwi`
  - The `bids_scan_type_subcategory` table will house the different sub-categories
    used by BIDS to describe a scan type. For example, resting-state fMRI and memory
    task fMRI scan types would have the following `BIDSScanTypeSubCategoryName`: a
    hyphen concatenated string, with the first part describing the BIDS imaging
    sub-category, "task" as an example here, and the second describing this sub-category,
    "rest" or "memory" as an example. Note that the second part after the hyphen is
    used in the JSON file for the header "TaskName"
  - Multi-echo sequences would be expected to see their `BIDSMultiEcho` column of the
    `bids_mri_scan_type_rel` table filled with "echo-1", "echo-2", etc...

Filling out these values properly as outlined in this description is mandatory as these
values will be used to rename the NIfTI file, as per the BIDS requirements.

# TO DO

    - Make the SliceOrder, which is currently an argument at the command line,
    more robust (such as making it adaptable across manufacturers that might not
    have this header present in the DICOMs, not just Philips like is currently the
    case in this script. In addition, this variable can/should be defined on a site
    per site basis.
    - Need to add to the multi-echo sequences a JSON file with the echo time within,
    as well as the originator NIfTI parent file. In addition, we need to check from
    the database if the sequence is indeed a multi-echo and require the
    C<BIDSMultiEcho> column set by the project in the C<bids_mri_scan_type_rel>
    table.

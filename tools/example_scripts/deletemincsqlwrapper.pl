=head1 NAME

deletemincsqlqrapper.pl -- This script is a wrapper for deleting multiple MINC
files at a time and optionally re-inserting them. It will pause for confirmation
before deleting. B<Projects should modify the query as needed to suit their
needs>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perl tools/example_scripts/deletemincsqlqrapper.pl C<[options]>

Available options are:

-profile      : Name of the config file in
                C<../../dicom-archive/.loris_mri>

-insertminc   : Re-insert the deleted MINC



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an B<example> script that does the following:
 - Deletes multiple MINC files fitting a common criterion from the database.
 - Provides the option to re-insert deleted scans with their series UID when
   using the C<-insertminc> flag.

B<Notes:>
 - B<Projects should modify the query as they see fit to suit their needs>.
 - For the example query provided (in C<$queryF>), all inserted scans with types
   like C<t1> or C<t2>, having a C<slice thickness> in the range of C<4 mm> will
   be deleted.
    - A use-case of this deletion query might be that initially the project did
    not exclude C<t1> or C<t2> modalities having 4 mm slice thickness, and
    subsequently, the study C<mri_protocol> table has been changed to add
    tighter checks on slice thickness.

*******************************************************************************
Wrapper to minc_deletion.pl for bulk deletion based on a SQL customisable query
*******************************************************************************

This script is a wrapper for deleting multiple MINC files at a time and
optionally re-inserting them. It will pause for confirmation before deleting.

Please note that this is an example script. Projects need to customize the query
based on their needs. Please refer to the associated documentation file in the
docs/scripts_md/ directory for more details. Alternatively, the documentation on
this script can be obtained as follows:
